Information
————————————

TEXTURE FLOW is an image gallery that loads images from a specific directory and displays them in several aesthetically pleasant ways.
It's especially useful for artists willing to expose their works or show image contents such as quadratic textures that are trivial in games.

————————————
View Modes
————————————
You can choose to display the images in many different ways which allows for customizations as well. The view modes include:

- grid 
- horizontal 
- vertical

————————————
How To Use
————————————

1 - On the top of the screen click on the GameObject menu and find Texture Flow. 
2 - Click on Create New Gallery. This will create a new gameObject in your scene called "Gallery".
3 - Simply select the "Gallery" gameObject in the hierarchy panel for adjusting its parameters in the inspector window.
4 - In the "Target Folder" field write the directory path for your images folder. e.g. "My Textures/128x128". 
5 - Hit play and there we go!

***Important***
Make sure your images folder is within the Resources directory. You don't need to include "Resources" in the directory path.

This plugin comes with a Demo scene. When you open it just hit play and it will automatically load the images from the samples 
folder. All of the sample icons are from the OUTLINED Icons pack that you can find here:
